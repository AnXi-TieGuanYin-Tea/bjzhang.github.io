Recently, there are lots of arm powered development board announced. A clearly differnce is lots of arm powered board support pcie and G ethernet Which is usually used in enterprise class senaro.

I would like compare the existing/announced board and buy some of them to try to understand this trend. I only compare the buyable board exclude the system which is not opened to real end user.

Distribution support. Because of the differences of arm SOC, a commercial support could not cover all the baord. Take Suse Linux Enterprise Server as example, Suse support 5 enterprise class board and one low-end board. And the SOC powered by AMD is supported by SUSE.
