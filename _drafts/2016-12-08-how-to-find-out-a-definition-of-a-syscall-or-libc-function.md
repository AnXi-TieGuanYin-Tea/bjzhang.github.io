Take sched_yield as example.

Check manpage to know it is a syscall or library function
---------------------------------------------------------

```
> man sched_yield
Man: find all matching manual pages (set MAN_POSIXLY_CORRECT to avoid this)
 * sched_yield (2)
   sched_yield (3p)
Man: What manual page do you want?
Man:
```

According to `man 1 man`, 2 is syscall.
```
    2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
    3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
```

Compare with `man getdents`, in the manpage of sched_yield, it does not mention that sched_yield is not wrapped by glibc.
```
> man getdents
GETDENTS(2)                                                                                Linux Programmer's Manual                                                                               GETDENTS(2)

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for these system calls; call them using syscall(2).  You will need to define the linux_dirent or linux_dirent64 structure yourself.  However, you probably want to use
       readdir(3) instead.

       These calls supersede readdir(2).
```

find the definition glibc
----------------------------
There are different ways to know where does glibc implement a syscall. E.g. we could grep the source code, find the syscall named source code or find the dependency file of glibc.

The easiest way when you have the coresponding compile is reading the dependency file:
```
> find . -name sched_yield.o.d
./posix/sched_yield.o.d
```

Usually, the second line of dependency mean the real definition. In sched_yield.o, we saw headers instead of c source code. It means that sched_yield is wrapped by the assembly language.
```
> head -n 2 posix/sched_yield.o
$(common-objpfx)posix/sched_yield.o: \
  ../include/stdc-predef.h ../include/libc-symbols.h \
```

We could confirm it in sysd-syscalls in build directory. All the syscalls found in this file started with "ifeq (,$(filter syscall_name,$(unix-syscalls)))" is wrapped by assembly language with following macro definition:
```
#### CALL=sched_yield NUMBER=(124) ARGS=i: SOURCE=-
ifeq (,$(filter sched_yield,$(unix-syscalls)))
unix-syscalls += sched_yield
$(foreach p,$(sysd-rules-targets),$(foreach o,$(object-suffixes),$(objpfx)$(patsubst %,$p,sched_yield)$o)): \
                $(..)sysdeps/unix/make-syscalls.sh
        $(make-target-directory)
        (echo '#define SYSCALL_NAME sched_yield'; \
         echo '#define SYSCALL_NARGS 0'; \
         echo '#define SYSCALL_SYMBOL __sched_yield'; \
         echo '#include <syscall-template.S>'; \
         echo 'weak_alias (__sched_yield, sched_yield)'; \
         echo 'libc_hidden_weak (sched_yield)'; \
        ) | $(compile-syscall) $(foreach p,$(patsubst %sched_yield,%,$(basename $(@F))),$($(p)CPPFLAGS))
endif
```

The above macro show that the name, number of args and symbol of syscall. There is also another two useful macro:
`#define SYSCALL_NOERRNO 1` means no error number will set after this syscall.
`#define SYSCALL_CANCELLABLE 1` means it is cancellable where pthread_cancel might happen. Reference "Cancellation points" in `man 7 pthreads`.

find the definition in kernel
-----------------------------
Most of the architecture supported by kernel make use of the `include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h` with their own option in unistd.h in arch/xxx. We could saw the file name of a syscall in this file.  "kernel/sched/core.c" for `sched_yield`.
```
> grep "\(\/\*.*\*\/\)\|\(sched_yield\)" include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h | grep sched_yield -B 1
/* kernel/sched/core.c */
#define __NR_sched_yield 124
__SYSCALL(__NR_sched_yield, sys_sched_yield)
```

Search "SYS.*sched_yield" will find the exactly location of definition.

find the definition of glibc(for library function)
--------------------------------------------------
As we mentioned by getdents is not wrapped by glibc. readdir is the recommandation of library for this functions. We could find the definition of `readdir()` with above method:
```
> head -n 2 `find . -name readdir.o.d`
$(common-objpfx)dirent/readdir.o: \
 ../sysdeps/posix/readdir.c ../include/stdc-predef.h \
```

When we search in source code, we could know the name of function by searching alias like this:
```
> grep alias sysdeps/posix/readdir.c | grep -w readdir
weak_alias (__readdir, readdir)
```

And we could find that __readdir call getdents/getdents64 through __getdents.

Q & A
-----
Q: Why we do not search the syscall named file in glibc source code directly?
A: Reason one: if the syscall is wrapped by assembly. There is no real definition of this syscall. In fact, sysd-syscalls is generated by sysdeps/unix/make-syscalls.sh based on the priority defined by Implies. The Implies file should read from the abi root directory. E.g. "sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/aarch64/lp64/Implies" for aarch64 LP64.
   Reason two: There might be several files, for readdir:
```
> find . -name readdir.c
./dirent/readdir.c
./sysdeps/posix/readdir.c
./sysdeps/mach/hurd/readdir.c
./sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/wordsize-64/readdir.c
```

For backtrace:
```
> find . -name backtrace.c
./debug/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/microblaze/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/tile/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/sparc/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/mips/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/arm/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/alpha/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/ia64/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/powerpc/powerpc64/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/powerpc/powerpc32/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/aarch64/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/i386/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/m68k/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/s390/s390-64/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/s390/s390-32/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/x86_64/backtrace.c
./sysdeps/sh/backtrace.c
```
