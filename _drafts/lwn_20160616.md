Kernel building with GCC plugins
http://lwn.net/Articles/691102/
Static-analysis tools can be useful in finding (and defending against) bugs and security problems in code but the mainline kernel will not support that before 4.8.
There are 12 plugins written by grsecurity team such as return value check, stack cleaner and so on.
Emese RÃ©vfy, one of the authers of above plugins, wrote two plugins which will be probably exist in 4.8 kernel.
One of them, called "sancov," inserts a tracing call at the beginning of each basic block of code. This feature is useful for anything requiring coverage tracking; it is aimed at thesyzkaller fuzz tester in particular.
